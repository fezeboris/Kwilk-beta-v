          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">What is Gender Based Violence (GBV)?</p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            Gender Based Violence is any act of violence committed against a
            person due to the person’s <b>gender</b> and results in
            <b>physical, psychological, sexual or economic harm.</b> Victims of
            Gender Based Violence suffer health consequences like
            <b
              >forced and unwanted pregnancies, STDs, trauma and
              stigmatization.</b
            >
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            In different regions in Cameroon, there are several conflicts. In
            the Northern regions <b>Boko Haram</b> constantly attacks civilians
            and children and kids are generally the target. Some girls are being
            kidnapped and forced into marriage by these terrorists and these
            kinds of acts are catalyzed by the fact that the girl child is
            considered to be less of a human as compared to the boy child. Apart
            from these<b>Boko Haram</b> attacks; certain
            <b>cultural and religious</b>
            beliefs have permitted gender-based violence for a long time.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            In the <b>North West and South West regions</b> of Cameroon, there
            is a war between
            <b>separatist fighters and the Cameroon army;</b> which lives again
            women and children very vulnerable as they are usually the targets.
            Young girls are targeted by
            <b> some irresponsible armed forces and forced to have sex.</b> They
            are many times forced into relationships and in general are at high
            risk to falling in the hands of sex predators.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            In the <b>Eastern region,</b> many young girls have been obliged to
            get into the <b>sex trade in order to make a living,</b> hence
            leaving them very exposed to gender based violence, in addition to
            refugees from the <b>Central African Republic,</b> have contributed
            in making this region very unsafe to live in; especially as the
            refugee camps are poorly funded. This leads to girls been targets of
            sexual gender-based violence by locals and even the male refugees.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            Although we have cited some regions, in the other regions, we still
            witness gender-based violence; especially in the form of
            <b>
              intimate partner violence, rape, sexually transmitted marks issued
              to female students,</b
            >
            just to name a few.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            Those whose rights are violated are also faced with weak health
            systems <b>(mental, clinical, psycho social)</b> are weak in
            capacity and resources, coupled with weak legal systems;
            materialized as unenforced laws and ignorance.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">
            Using Technology to help reduce Gender Based Violence.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            In the context of general insecurity (In the North West and South
            West Regions, East Region, North Region),
            <b>misinformation, stigmatization and weak legal systems,</b> it
            becomes very common to get cases of young girls and women who have
            been abused and left helpless without any proper care. Nonetheless,
            with the increasingly high adoption of
            <b> mobile phones</b> especially with <b>GPS capability</b> and
            increasing internet access, these young girls now have an
            opportunity to be heard by people who truly care about them and who
            can help them at least receive the care they need. Availability of
            ‘<b>Okadas’</b> i.e., bike riders make it easy for anyone to get
            first aid care even in the most interior zones. National policies
            providing social care and social system structures have been
            developed over the years hence making it easier for Gender Based
            Violence victims to receive care.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            Thanks to advancements in technology, and availability of local app
            development firms and institutes like
            <b> eBASE (Effective Basic Services) Africa</b> in collaboration
            with <b>Vinsight technologies, Geovation Collaborations</b>, and
            <b>Silicon Mountain</b> and with funding from the
            <b>French embassy Cameroon under the PISCCA program,</b> we have the
            capacity of building technological solutions which can provide a way
            for Victims to report anonymously, get help and get free educational
            content. Stakeholders too can now in real time gain access to real
            time information on Gender Based Violence cases and based on this
            information take necessary measures to solve this wicked problem.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">
            How does the Kwikklik App help reduce and prevent Gender Based
            Violence (GBV)?.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            It is made of a <b>reporting unit</b> platform which uses an
            innovative approach in which mobile phones can be used to report 3D
            (<b>GPS, Image, Voice, Time</b>) data of GBV cases. A
            <b>mapping unit</b>
            wherein stakeholders can view data of anonymized GBV victims. A
            <b>preventive unit</b> where crowd sourced data and artificial
            intelligence (AI) will be used to help notify people in a certain
            area about the risks of GBV.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            In cases where the harm has already been done, the
            <b> consultancy unit</b> permits victims get in contact easily with
            experts (<b>medical, psychology and legal</b>) and emergency units
            (<b>‘Okadas’</b>), so that they can be taken immediate care of.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">
            In order to create awareness and prevent future cases of GBV, the
            <b>education unit</b> will help sensitize users about measures of
            prevention of GBV and also emergency steps to be taken when such
            crimes are committed.
